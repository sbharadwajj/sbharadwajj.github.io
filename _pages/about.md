I am advised by [Michael J. Black](https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/black) and [Victoria Fernández Abrevaya](https://vabrevaya.github.io/). My research interest lies in the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics, particularly, in relighting. I have worked on inverse rendering and 3D reconstruction in the past. In constrast, I am currently exploring if relighting can be achieved through neural rendering without explicitly modeling the geometry, material and lighting. 

I completed my masters in Machine Learning at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/studium/studienangebot/verzeichnis-der-studiengaenge/detail/course/machine-learning-master/). For my masters thesis, I worked on improving 3D reconstruction by exploring the benefits of depth information for radiance fields at [Autonomous Vision Group](https://www.cvlibs.net/index.php). 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
