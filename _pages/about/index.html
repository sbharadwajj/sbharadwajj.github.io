<p>I am a full-time research intern at the <a href="https://ps.is.mpg.de/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Perceiving Systems Department</a> at Max-Planck Institute of Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, Germany. I am advised by <a href="https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/black" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michael Black</a> and <a href="https://vabrevaya.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Victoria Fernández Abrevaya</a>.</p>

<p>My research interest lies in the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics. I am particularly interested in reconstructing 3D models from 2D images.</p>

<p>I completed my masters in Machine Learning at the <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/studium/studiengaenge/machine-learning/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Tübingen</a> and I worked in the Autonomous Vision Group for my masters thesis, supervised by <a href="https://www.cvlibs.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Andreas Geiger</a>. My thesis focused on improving 3D reconstruction of static urban environments by exploring the benefits of depth information for radiance fields.</p>

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
